## Who are we?

We are a team of AI researchers and developers passionate about helping you build the next generation of AI assistants. **Neosantara AI is independently developed by a dedicated individual**, with a commitment to providing advanced and easily accessible AI technology.

Our mission is to empower individuals and organizations with accurate, unbiased, and factual information through cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence technology.

## What is the Neosantara APIs?

Building AI agents that leverage real-time online information or other advanced capabilities is not a simple task. Neosantara AI serves as a platform optimized for various generative (LLM) and multimodal AI models, aiming to provide efficient, fast, and reliable API access.

Neosantara AI takes on the burden of integrating, optimizing, and managing diverse AI models from various providers, allowing you to focus on developing your core applications. All in a single API call!

<Note>
  While Neosantara AI provides access to various AI models from different providers (such as Google Gemini, OpenAI, Cohere, and others), please note that **Neosantara AI is an independent product and is not directly affiliated with the providers of these models**. We serve as a gateway to help you interact with their technology.

## How does the Neosantara AI API work??

The Neosantara AI API handles the complexities of interacting with various advanced AI models. Instead of managing multiple APIs from different providers, Neosantara AI acts as a single gateway. It takes care of all the overhead in selecting the best model, formatting requests, and optimizing responses, all within a single API call.

Neosantara AI can aggregate capabilities from various models to deliver the most relevant responses to your task, query, or goal. Additionally, Neosantara AI allows developers to add custom parameters such as context and limit response tokens to enable an optimal AI experience.

Neosantara AI can also help your AI agents make better decisions by providing structured information or summaries for cross-agent communication.

Here's a simplified diagram illustrating the core flow of the Neosantara AI API:
