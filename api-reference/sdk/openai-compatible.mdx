title: 'OpenAI Compatibility'
description: '> Use the official OpenAI SDK to interact with the Neosantara AI API.'
---

Neosantara AI provides a robust compatibility layer that enables you to use the official OpenAI SDKs to interact with our API. With only a few minor code changes, you can quickly evaluate Neosantara AI model capabilities or even migrate existing applications.

<Note>
  While this compatibility layer is fully supported, our priority remains the reliability and performance of the native **[Neosantara AI API](/api-reference/introduction)**. For the best experience and access to our complete feature set, we recommend using our modern `/v1/responses` endpoint.
</Note>

## Getting Started

To use the OpenAI SDK, you only need to change three things in your existing code:
1.  **Update the `base_url`** to point to Neosantara AI's API endpoint.
2.  **Replace your API key** with a [Neosantara AI API key](https://app.neosantara.xyz/dashboard).
3.  **Update the model name** to a [Neosantara AI model](/en/models-overview).

### Quick Start: `responses` API (Recommended)

The `/v1/responses` endpoint is our most powerful and modern API. Use `client.responses.create()` to access it.

<CodeGroup>
```python icon="python" py
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="<NAI_API_KEY>",
    base_url="https://api.neosantara.xyz/v1"
)

response = client.responses.create(
    model="nusantara-base",
    input="Who are you?"
)

# Access the response text
print(response.output_text)
````

```typescript icon="square-js" js
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const openai = new OpenAI({
    apiKey: "<NAI_API_KEY>",
    baseURL: "https://api.neosantara.xyz/v1",
});

const response = await openai.responses.create({
    input: "Who are you?",
    model: "nusantara-base",
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

</CodeGroup>

### Quick Start: `chat/completions` API (Legacy)

The `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint is available for seamless compatibility with existing applications. Use `client.chat.completions.create()` to access it.

<CodeGroup>

```python icon="python" py
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
api_key="<NAI_API_KEY>",
base_url="https://api.neosantara.xyz/v1"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
model="nusantara-base",
messages=[
{"role": "user", "content": "Who are you?"}
],
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)

```

```typescript icon="square-js" js
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const openai = new OpenAI({
    apiKey: "<NAI_API_KEY>",
    baseURL: "https://api.neosantara.xyz/v1",
});

const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    messages: [
        { role: "user", content: "Who are you?" }
    ],
    model: "nusantara-base",
});

console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
```

</CodeGroup>

## Feature Compatibility Details

While we aim for maximum compatibility, there are some differences in how certain features are implemented.

#### System / Developer Messages

The concept of a `system` prompt is fully supported. For some underlying providers that don't have a native system role, the content of your system message will be automatically prepended to the first user message to ensure the model follows your instructions.

#### Reasoning

Neosantara AI supports advanced reasoning through a special `reasoning` parameter available in both the `/v1/responses` and `/v1/chat/completions` endpoints.

```python
# This parameter is supported by Neosantara AI
response = client.responses.create(
    model="nusantara-base",
    input="Solve this complex logic puzzle...",
    reasoning={"effort": "high"}
)
```

#### Conversation State (`store`)

The `store: true` and `previous_response_id` parameters are **fully supported** in the `/v1/responses` endpoint. This allows you to build stateful conversations without manually resending the entire chat history. This feature is not available for `/v1/chat/completions`.

#### Tools

The `tools: {}` is not supported on `/v1/responses` endpoint. Use the `/v1/chat/completions` instead.

## Detailed Parameter Support

Most unsupported fields are silently ignored to prevent errors.

| Field | Support Status & Notes |
|---|---|
| `model` | **Fully supported**. Use Neosantara AI model names. |
| `messages` | **Fully supported** in `/v1/chat/completions`. |
| `input` / `instructions`| **Fully supported** in `/v1/responses`. |
| `max_tokens` | **Fully supported**. |
| `stream` | **Fully supported** for both endpoints. |
| `temperature` | **Fully supported**. |
| `top_p` | **Fully supported**. |
| `stop` | **Fully supported**. |
| `presence_penalty` | **Fully supported**. |
| `frequency_penalty` | **Fully supported**. |
| `response_format` | **Fully supported**. `json_schema` is only available in `/v1/responses`. |
| `tools` / `functions` | **Fully supported**. `strict` mode is handled on a best-effort basis by the underlying provider. |
| `tool_choice` | **Fully supported**. |
| `n` | Ignored. Only one choice (`n=1`) is supported. |
| `logprobs` / `top_logprobs` | Ignored. |
