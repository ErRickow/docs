  <Step title="Make Your First Request">
    Copy the code below to test your connection. Replace `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with the key you generated.

    <CodeGroup>
    ```javascript Node.js icon="square-js"
    import OpenAI from "openai";

    const client = new OpenAI({
      baseURL: "https://api.neosantara.xyz/v1",
      apiKey: "<YOUR_API_KEY>", // process.env.NAI_API_KEY
    });

    async function main() {
      const completion = await client.chat.completions.create({
        model: "nusantara-base",
        messages: [
          { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." },
          { role: "user", content: "Hello! Who are you?" },
        ],
      });

      console.log(completion.choices[0].message.content);
    }

    main();
    ```

    ```python Python icon="py"
    from openai import OpenAI

    client = OpenAI(
        base_url="https://api.neosantara.xyz/v1",
        api_key="<YOUR_API_KEY>" // os.environ.get("NAI_API_KEY")
    )

    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="nusantara-base",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
            {"role": "user", "content": "Hello! Who are you?"}
        ]
    )
