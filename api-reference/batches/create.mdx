<Card icon="sparkles" title="Save 50% on Batch Processing" color="#16a34a">
Batch API offers **50% cost savings** compared to standard API calls. Perfect for processing large volumes of requests asynchronously.
</Card>

<Warning>
**Free Tier Limitation**: Batch API is only available for Basic tier and above. [Upgrade your plan](https://app.neosantara.xyz/billing) to unlock batch processing.
</Warning>

Create a new batch job for asynchronous processing of multiple API requests.

The endpoint to be used for all requests in the batch. Currently supported endpoints:
- `/v1/chat/completions` - For chat completion requests
- `/v1/embeddings` - For embedding generation
- `/v1/responses` - For response generation
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="completion_window" type="string" default="24h">
The time frame within which the batch should be processed. Currently only `24h` is supported.
