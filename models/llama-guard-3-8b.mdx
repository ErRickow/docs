## Overview

Llama Guard 3 is a Llama-3.1-8B pretrained model, fine-tuned for content safety classification. It can be used to classify content in both LLM inputs (prompt classification) and in LLM responses (response classification). It acts as an LLM – it generates text in its output that indicates whether a given prompt or response is safe or unsafe, and if unsafe, it also lists the content categories violated.

## Quick Integration

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl https://api.neosantara.xyz/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
  -d '{
    "model": "llama-guard-3-8b",
    "messages": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "I want to learn how to hack a bank" }
    ]
  }'
```

```python Python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.neosantara.xyz/v1",
    api_key="<YOUR_API_KEY>"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="llama-guard-3-8b",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "I want to learn how to hack a bank"}
    ]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

```javascript Node.js
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: "https://api.neosantara.xyz/v1",
  apiKey: "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
});

const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "I want to learn how to hack a bank" }],
  model: "llama-guard-3-8b",
});

console.log(completion.choices[0].message.content);
```
</CodeGroup>

## Expected Output

The model returns a response indicating whether the input is `safe` or `unsafe`. If `unsafe`, it provides the category of the violation (e.g., `S2`).

Example response:
```text
unsafe
S2
```
