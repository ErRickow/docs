## Quick Integration

You can use `titan-image-g1` via the standard OpenAI SDK by pointing the `base_url` to Neosantara.

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl https://api.neosantara.xyz/v1/images/generations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
  -d '{
    "model": "titan-image-g1",
    "prompt": "A futuristic city in Indonesia, traditional batik architecture, cyberpunk style, photorealistic, 8k",
    "size": "512x512",
    "response_format": "url"
  }'
```

```python Python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.neosantara.xyz/v1",
    api_key="<YOUR_API_KEY>"
)

response = client.images.generate(
    model="titan-image-g1",
    prompt="A futuristic city in Indonesia, traditional batik architecture",
    size="1024x1024"
)

print(response.data[0].url)
```

## Advanced Usage

### Inpainting Example

To modify an image, provide the base image and a mask.

```json
{
  "model": "titan-image-g1",
  "prompt": "Add a flying drone in the sky",
  "image": "base64_encoded_image...",
  "mask_image": "base64_encoded_mask...",
  "size": "512x512"
}
```

### Outpainting Example

To extend an image, set the `outpainting_mode`.

```json
{
  "model": "titan-image-g1",
  "prompt": "Extend the mountain landscape to the left",
  "image": "base64_encoded_image...",
  "outpainting_mode": "DEFAULT",
  "size": "1024x1024"
}
```
