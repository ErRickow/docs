## Multimodal Capabilities

GLM 4.6V Flash is uniquely positioned as a cost-effective model that supports video input alongside images and text.

### Video Input Example

You can pass a video URL directly in the content array:

```json
{
  "model": "glm-4.6v-flash",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        { "type": "text", "text": "What happens in this video?" },
        { "type": "video_url", "video_url": { "url": "https://example.com/video.mp4" } }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Native Reasoning

This model supports native reasoning. When enabled, it provides a thought process before the final answer, wrapped in `<think>` tags.
