Neosantara AI implements throughput limits to ensure platform stability and fair resource allocation. This system manages the rate of incoming requests and token processing.

For information on billing, credit balances, and quota migration, please refer to the [Token Credits & Pricing](/en/about/token-credits) documentation.

## Throughput Limits (Speed)

Throughput limits restrict the rate of operations over a specific time window. These are technical constraints designed to prevent system overload and are distinct from billing limits.

The system enforces three types of throughput limits:

* **RPM (Requests Per Minute):** The maximum number of HTTP requests allowed per minute.
* **ITPM (Input Tokens Per Minute):** The maximum number of input tokens processed per minute.
* **OTPM (Output Tokens Per Minute):** The maximum number of output tokens generated per minute.

### Standard API Limits

| Tier | RPM | ITPM | OTPM |
| :--- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Free | 3 | 5,000 | 2,000 |
| Basic | 50 | 20,000 | 5,000 |
| Standard | 1,000 | 100,000 | 25,000 |
| Pro | 2,000 | 200,000 | 50,000 |
| Enterprise | 4,000 | 500,000 | 125,000 |

### CLI Limits

| Tier | RPM | TPM (Total Tokens/min) |
| :--- | :-- | :-- |
| Free | 10 | 10,000 |
| Basic | 60 | 50,000 |
| Standard | 1,000 | 100,000 |
| Pro | 2,000 | 200,000 |
| Enterprise | Unlimited | Unlimited |

<Note>
**Tier Upgrades:** Throughput tiers are automatically adjusted based on your total deposit history. See [Token Credits & Pricing](/en/about/token-credits#throughput-tiers-speed) for details.

## Response Headers

API responses include standard HTTP headers that provide real-time status of the client's rate limit usage. Clients should monitor these headers to avoid hitting rate limits.

| Header | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `x-neosantara-ratelimit-requests-limit` | The maximum RPM allowed. |
| `x-neosantara-ratelimit-requests-remaining` | The number of requests remaining in the current window. |
| `x-neosantara-ratelimit-requests-reset` | The time (ISO 8601) when the request limit resets. |
| `x-neosantara-ratelimit-input-tokens-limit` | The maximum ITPM allowed. |
| `x-neosantara-ratelimit-input-tokens-remaining` | The number of input tokens remaining in the current window. |
| `x-neosantara-ratelimit-input-tokens-reset` | The time (ISO 8601) when the input token limit resets. |
| `x-neosantara-ratelimit-output-tokens-limit` | The maximum OTPM allowed. |
| `x-neosantara-ratelimit-output-tokens-remaining` | The number of output tokens remaining in the current window. |
| `x-neosantara-ratelimit-output-tokens-reset` | The time (ISO 8601) when the output token limit resets. |
| `x-neosantara-tier` | The current throughput tier assigned to the account. |

## Error Handling

### 429 Too Many Requests

This error indicates that one of the technical **Throughput Limits** (RPM, ITPM, or OTPM) has been exceeded. The response includes a `Retry-After` header specifying the wait time in seconds before a new request can be made.

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Too many requests. Please try again later.",
    "type": "rate_limit_exceeded",
    "code": "rpm_exceeded",
    "details": {
        "retry_after": 5,
        "limit": 50,
        "remaining": 0,
        "reset": "2025-12-16T10:30:05.000Z"
    }
  }
}
```
