Our rate limiting is token-based, ensuring a fair and transparent approach to API usage. This system helps maintain service quality for all users by preventing excessive consumption of resources. Limits are enforced on **tokens per day** and **tokens per month** (stored in our database). Additional limits on requests per day and per minute are enforced programmatically using Upstash Redis. See [Token Credits & Pricing](/en/about/token-credits#pricing-overview) for more details.

## Tier Limits

These are the maximum token limits for each plan, tracked in our database. All paid plans are priced at **Rp 149.99 per 1,000 tokens** (~Rp 0.15 per token). The **Custom** plan allows flexible top-ups starting from 66,667 tokens (Rp 9,999).

**Note**: Cost per 1K Tokens is calculated as $Rp 0.15 per token Ã— 1,000 = Rp 149.99$, equivalent to Rp 149.999 per 1 million tokens.

| Tier       | Tokens per Day | Tokens per Month   | Cost per 1K Tokens |
|------------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| Free       | 3,000          | 10,000             | Rp 0              |
| Basic      | 10,000         | 66,667             | Rp 149.99         |
| Standard   | 40,000         | 400,000            | Rp 149.99         |
| Pro        | 100,000        | 1,000,000          | Rp 149.99         |
| Custom     | 10% of Monthly | custom | Rp 149.99         |

## Response Headers

Every API response includes usage information within the `_metadata` field. This allows you to track your current consumption against your plan limits directly from your application.

```json
{
  "_metadata": {
    "usage": {
      "daily": {
        "current": 50,
        "limit": 1500, // Example limit for Free tier
        "reset_date": "2025-07-28T00:00:00Z",
        "remaining": 1450
      },
      "monthly": {
        "current": 500,
        "limit": 7500, // Example limit for Free tier
        "reset_date": "2025-08-01T00:00:00Z",
        "remaining": 7000
      }
    },
    "tier": {
      "name": "Free",
      "priority": 1
    }
  }
}
```

## Rate Limit Errors

When your API usage exceeds the allocated rate limit for your plan, the API will return an HTTP Status Code `429: Too Many Requests`. The response body will include details about the exceeded limit and when it will reset.

```json
{
  "status": false,
  "creator": "neosantara.xyz",
  "error": {
    "message": "Daily token limit exceeded for your account (1500).",
    "type": "usage_limit_exceeded",
    "code": "user_total_daily_limit_exceeded"
  },
  "usage": {
    "current": 1500,
    "limit": 1500,
    "reset_date": "2025-07-28T00:00:00Z",
    "remaining": 0
  },
  "tier": "Free",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-27T04:10:59Z"
}
