Neosantara AI employs a robust **Hybrid Rate Limiting** system designed to ensure platform stability while providing flexibility for all users. This system consists of two layers: **Throughput Limits** (Speed) and **Volume Limits** (Billing).

---

## 1. Throughput Limits (Speed)

To prevent abuse and ensure fair usage, we enforce strict speed limits based on **Requests Per Minute (RPM)**, **Input Tokens Per Minute (ITPM)**, and **Output Tokens Per Minute (OTPM)**. These are technical constraints and apply to all users, including those on Pay-As-You-Go.

### Throughput Limits per Tier

| Tier | RPM (Requests/min) | ITPM (Input Tokens/min) | OTPM (Output Tokens/min) |
| :--- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Free | 3 | 5,000 | 2,000 |
| Basic | 50 | 20,000 | 5,000 |
| Standard | 1,000 | 100,000 | 25,000 |
| Pro | 2,000 | 200,000 | 50,000 |
| Enterprise | 4,000 | 500,000 | 125,000 |

<Note>
  **Note:** The Admin tier and specific Enterprise agreements may have custom or unlimited throughput limits.
</Note>

## 2. Volume Limits (Billing)

Volume limits determine how many total tokens you can consume in a month based on your subscription.

1.  **Quota Users (Legacy/Hybrid):** You have a fixed Monthly Quota (e.g., 10,000 tokens for Free). Once exceeded, you are automatically switched to Pay-As-You-Go.
2.  **Pay-As-You-Go Users:** There are **no hard volume limits**. You can generate as much as you want, provided you have sufficient **Credit Balance**.

## Response Headers

We provide transparent, real-time feedback on your current usage limits via standard HTTP headers. These headers are present on every API response.

| Header | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `x-neosantara-ratelimit-requests-limit` | Your RPM limit. |
| `x-neosantara-ratelimit-requests-remaining` | Requests remaining in the current 1-minute window. |
| `x-neosantara-ratelimit-requests-reset` | Time (ISO 8601) when the RPM window resets. |
| `x-neosantara-ratelimit-input-tokens-limit` | Your ITPM limit. |
| `x-neosantara-ratelimit-input-tokens-remaining` | Input tokens remaining in the current 1-minute window. |
| `x-neosantara-ratelimit-input-tokens-reset` | Time (ISO 8601) when the ITPM window resets. |
| `x-neosantara-ratelimit-output-tokens-limit` | Your OTPM limit. |
| `x-neosantara-ratelimit-output-tokens-remaining` | Output tokens remaining in the current 1-minute window. |
| `x-neosantara-ratelimit-output-tokens-reset` | Time (ISO 8601) when the OTPM window resets. |
| `x-neosantara-tier` | Your current Tier (e.g., Free, Basic, Pro). |

### Example Headers

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
x-neosantara-ratelimit-requests-limit: 50
x-neosantara-ratelimit-requests-remaining: 49
x-neosantara-ratelimit-requests-reset: 2025-12-16T10:30:00.000Z
x-neosantara-ratelimit-input-tokens-limit: 20000
x-neosantara-ratelimit-input-tokens-remaining: 19950
x-neosantara-ratelimit-output-tokens-limit: 5000
x-neosantara-ratelimit-output-tokens-remaining: 4900
x-neosantara-tier: Basic
```

## Error Handling

### 429 Too Many Requests
Occurs when you exceed any of the throughput limits (RPM, ITPM, or OTPM). The response will include a `Retry-After` header indicating how many seconds to wait.

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Too many requests. Please try again later.",
    "type": "rate_limit_exceeded",
    "code": "rpm_exceeded", // or itpm_exceeded, otpm_exceeded
    "details": {
        "retry_after": 5,
        "limit": 50,
        "remaining": 0,
        "reset": "2025-12-16T10:30:05.000Z"
    }
  }
}
```

### 402 Payment Required
Occurs when you are in Pay-As-You-Go mode but have insufficient **Credit Balance**.

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Insufficient balance. Your request is estimated to cost ~Rp 150 but you only have Rp 50.",
    "type": "insufficient_balance",
    "code": "payment_required"
  }
}
```
