Our **token-based** rate limiting system ensures a fair and transparent approach to API usage. This system helps maintain service quality for all users by preventing excessive resource consumption. Limits are enforced on **tokens per day (TPD)** and **total monthly token limit (Monthly Token Limit)**, which are tracked and stored in our database. Additional limits on **requests per day (RPD)** and **requests per minute (RPM)** are enforced programmatically using Upstash Redis. For more details on token credits and pricing, please refer to [Token Credits & Pricing](/en/about/token-credits#pricing-overview).

## Rate Limits

Rate limits are measured across five key dimensions:

* **`Requests per minute (RPM)`**: The maximum number of API requests you can send within one minute.
* **`Tokens per minute (TPM)`**: The maximum number of tokens (input) you can use within one minute.
* **`Requests per day (RPD)`**: The maximum number of API requests you can send within one day.
* **`Tokens per day (TPD)`**: The maximum number of tokens (both input and output) you can use within one day.
* **`Monthly Token Limit`**: The maximum total tokens (both input and output) you can use within one calendar month.

Below are the maximum token limits for each plan, tracked in our database. All paid plans are priced at **Rp 149.99 per 1,000 tokens** (~Rp 0.15 per token). The **Custom** plan allows flexible top-ups starting from 66,667 tokens (Rp 9,999).

**Note**: Cost per 1K Tokens is calculated as $Rp 0.15 \text{ per token} \times 1,000 = Rp 149.99$, equivalent to $Rp 149,999 \text{ per 1 million tokens}$.

| Tier | RPM | TPD | TPM | Monthly Token Limit |
| :--------- | :---- | :-------- | :--------------- | :------------------------- |
| Free | 5 | 3,000 | 2,000 | 10,000 (Est.) |
| Basic | 30 | 10,000 | 10,000 | 66,667 (Est.) |
| Standard | 100 | 40,000 | 100,000 | 400,000 (Est.) |
| Pro | 400 | 100,000 | 200,000 | 1,000,000 (Est.) |
| Enterprise | Custom| Custom | Custom | Custom |

## Response Headers

Every API response includes usage information within the `_metadata` field. This allows you to track your current consumption against your plan limits directly from your application.

```json
{
  "_metadata": {
    "usage": {
      "daily": {
        "current": 50,
        "limit": 1500, // Example TPD limit for Free tier
        "reset_date": "2025-07-28T00:00:00Z",
        "remaining": 1450
      },
      "monthly": {
        "current": 500,
        "limit": 7500, // Example Monthly Token Limit for Free tier
        "reset_date": "2025-08-01T00:00:00Z",
        "remaining": 7000
      }
    },
    "tier": {
      "name": "Free",
      "priority": 1
    }
  }
}
```

## Rate Limit Errors

When your API usage exceeds the allocated rate limit for your plan, the API will return an HTTP Status Code `429: Too Many Requests`. The response body will include details about the exceeded limit and when it will reset.

```json
{
  "status": false,
  "creator": "neosantara.xyz",
  "error": {
    "message": "Daily token limit exceeded for your account (1500).",
    "type": "usage_limit_exceeded",
    "code": "user_total_daily_limit_exceeded"
  },
  "usage": {
    "current": 1500,
    "limit": 1500,
    "reset_date": "2025-07-28T00:00:00Z",
    "remaining": 0
  },
  "tier": "Free",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-27T04:10:59Z"
}
```
