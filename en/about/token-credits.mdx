## Pay-As-You-Go System

Neosantara AI operates on a **Pay-As-You-Go** billing system. Users are billed based on actual usage (tokens processed or images generated) without mandatory monthly subscription fees or restrictive volume limits.

### Getting Started

1. **Registration:** Create a new account on the platform.
2. **Email Verification:** Verify your email address to receive an initial **Rp 20,000 Balance Credit**.
3. **API Access:** Access is granted immediately with usage billed against the credit balance. Volume is subject to available funds and account tier throughput limits (RPM/TPM).

## Pricing Structure

Usage costs are calculated per request based on the specific model selected. While most rates are shown in **IDR (Rupiah)**, some models remain priced in **USD** as noted in the table. USD costs are converted to IDR at the time of billing based on current exchange rates.

### Batch Processing

The Batch API offers asynchronous processing for high-volume requests at a reduced rate. This is suitable for tasks that do not require immediate responses, such as bulk data processing.

| Usage Type | Rate Adjustment |
| :--- | :--- |
| Batch Input | **50% of** standard input price |
| Batch Output | **50% of** standard output price |

<Note>
The discount is applied automatically for requests sent to the `/v1/batches` endpoint.

## Throughput Tiers (Speed Limits)

**Throughput Limits** (RPM/TPM) are determined by the account's Tier. The Tier level is automatically adjusted based on the **Total Lifetime Deposit**.

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Free** | Rp 0 | 3 | 5,000 | 2,000 |
| **Basic** | **Rp 85,000** | 50 | 20,000 | 5,000 |
| **Standard** | **Rp 670,000** | 1,000 | 100,000 | 25,000 |
| **Pro** | **Rp 3,350,000** | 2,000 | 200,000 | 50,000 |
| **Enterprise** | **Rp 6,700,000** | 4,000 | 500,000 | 125,000 |

<Note>
**Tier Upgrade:** Tier upgrades occur automatically once the account's total deposit history reaches the specified threshold.
