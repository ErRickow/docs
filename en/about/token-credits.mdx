## Pay-As-You-Go System

Neosantara AI operates primarily on a **Pay-As-You-Go** billing system. Users are billed based on actual usage without mandatory monthly subscription fees or restrictive volume limits.

---

## Legacy Users (Transition)

Users registered prior to the Pay-As-You-Go update operate under a **Legacy Plan**:
1.  **Quota Usage:** Monthly Token Quotas remain active and are prioritized.
2.  **Automatic Migration:** Upon exceeding the monthly quota for the first time, the account is automatically and permanently migrated to the **Pay-As-You-Go Mode**.
3.  **Transition Credit:** A one-time credit of **Rp 10,000** is granted upon migration to ensure service continuity.

---

## Pricing Structure

Usage costs are calculated per request based on the specific model selected. Prices are listed in **IDR (Rupiah)**. Models originally priced in USD are converted to IDR based on dynamic exchange rates.

### Batch Processing

The Batch API offers asynchronous processing for high-volume requests at a reduced rate. This is suitable for tasks that do not require immediate responses, such as bulk data processing.

| Usage Type | Rate Adjustment |
| :--- | :--- |
| Batch Input | **50% of** standard input price |
| Batch Output | **50% of** standard output price |

<Note>
The discount is applied automatically for requests sent to the [`/v1/batches`](/api-reference/batches/overview) endpoint.
</Note>
