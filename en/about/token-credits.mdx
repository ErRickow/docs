## API Credits Costs
.
Neosantara AI API usage is calculated based on the number of Tokens processed per request, for both `input` and `output`. Each model has different characteristics and Token costs.

To calculate costs:
- **Price = Tokens x Rp 0.15** (per token).
- **Price = (Tokens รท 1,000) x Rp 149.99** (per 1,000 tokens).

- $Price = Tokens \times Rp\ 0.15$ (per token).
- $Price = \left( \frac{Tokens}{1000} \right) \times Rp\ 149.99$ (per 1,000 tokens).
- $Price = \left( \frac{Tokens}{1000000} \right) \times Rp\ 149999$ (per 1 million tokens).

<RequestExample>
For 100,000 tokens:
  $$
  Price = 100000 \times 0.15 = 15,000
  $$
  or
  $$
  Price = \left( \frac{100,000}{1,000} \right) \times 149.99 = 14,999
  $$
  Both give Rp 15,000 (rounded).

### How Token Costs Are Calculated

* **Basic Text Processing (e.g., Chat Completions):**
  * Each basic text request consumes Tokens based on the length of the input text (prompt and chat history) and the generated output text.

* **Special Functions & Advanced Capabilities (e.g., function_calling, web_search):**
  * When models utilize advanced capabilities such as `calling external functions` or performing `web searches`, the Token cost for that request will reflect the additional computational complexity and data processing involved. The exact cost varies per request based on the actual operations performed by the model.

### Tracking Your Usage

The most accurate way to track the Token cost of each request, especially for advanced features and multimodal inputs, is through the `tokens_used` field in the API response's `_metadata` section or by checking your [Usage Dashboard](https://app.neosantara.xyz/usage).
