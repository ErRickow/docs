## API Credit Costs

Neosantara AI API usage is calculated based on the number of **Tokens processed per request**, covering both `input` and `output`. Each model has different characteristics and token costs.

To calculate costs:
- **Price = Tokens × Rp 0.15** (per token).
- **Price = (Tokens ÷ 1,000) × Rp 149.99** (per 1,000 tokens).

$$Price = \text{Tokens} \times \text{Rp } 0.15 \text{ (per token)}$$
$$Price = \left( \frac{\text{Tokens}}{1000} \right) \times \text{Rp } 149.99 \text{ (per 1,000 tokens)}$$

Example for 100,000 tokens:
$$Price = 100,000 \times 0.15 = \text{Rp } 15,000$$
or
$$Price = \left( \frac{100,000}{1,000} \right) \times 149.99 = \text{Rp } 14,999$$
Both calculations yield approximately Rp 15,000 (rounded for simplicity).

### How Token Costs Are Calculated

* **Basic Text Processing (e.g., Chat Completions):**
    * Each basic text request consumes tokens based on the length of the input text (prompt and chat history) and the generated output text.

* **Special Functions & Advanced Capabilities (e.g., *function calling*, *web search*):**
    * When models utilize advanced capabilities such as *function calling* or *web search*, the token cost for that request will reflect the additional computational complexity and data processing involved. The exact cost varies per request based on the actual operations performed by the model.

### Tracking Your Usage

The most accurate way to track the token cost of each request, especially for advanced features and multimodal inputs, is through the `tokens_used` field in the API response's `_metadata` section or by checking your [Usage Dashboard](https://app.neosantara.xyz/usage), where you can view token usage history, remaining credits.
