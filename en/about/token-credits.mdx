## Pay-As-You-Go System

Neosantara AI operates on a **Pay-As-You-Go** billing system. Users are billed based on actual usage (tokens processed or images generated) without mandatory monthly subscription fees. Volume is subject to available funds and account tier throughput limits (RPM/TPM).

### Getting Started

1. **Registration:** Create a new account on the platform.
2. **Email Verification:** Verify your email address to receive an initial **Rp 20,000 Balance Credit**.
3. **API Access:** Access is granted immediately with usage billed against the credit balance. Volume is subject to available funds and account tier throughput limits (RPM/TPM).

## Pricing Structure

Usage costs are calculated per request based on the specific model selected. While most rates are shown in **IDR (Rupiah)**, some models remain priced in **USD**. USD costs are converted to IDR at the time of billing based on current exchange rates.

### Batch Processing

The Batch API offers asynchronous processing for high-volume requests at a reduced rate. This is suitable for tasks that do not require immediate responses, such as bulk data processing.

| Usage Type | Rate Adjustment |
| :--- | :--- |
| Batch Input | **50% of** standard input price |
| Batch Output | **50% of** standard output price |

<Note>
The discount is applied automatically for requests sent to the `/v1/batches` endpoint.
