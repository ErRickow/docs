## API Credits Costs

Neosantara AI API usage is calculated based on the number of tokens processed per request, for both `input` and `output`. Our infrastructure uses a fallback system (e.g., Groq, Gemini, etc.) to ensure reliability, but token costs remain consistent for users.

### How Token Costs Are Calculated

- **Basic Text Processing (e.g., Chat Completions):**
  - Each request consumes tokens based on the length of input text (prompt and chat history) and generated output text. On average, 1 token ≈ 4 characters or 0.75 words.

- **Special Functions & Advanced Capabilities (e.g., function_calling, web_search):**
  - Advanced features like `calling external functions` or `web searches` incur additional token costs due to increased computational complexity and data processing. Costs vary per request based on operations performed.

- **SLA Guarantee (Pro and Custom ≥1M tokens):**
  - For Pro and Custom plans with ≥1 million tokens, we guarantee 99.9% API uptime and fast support response times (<1 hour for critical issues). If unmet, you may receive token credits.

### Tracking Your Usage

Track token costs accurately via:

- The `tokens_used` field in the API response's `_metadata` section.
- Your [Usage Dashboard](https://app.neosantara.xyz/usage) for real-time insights.
