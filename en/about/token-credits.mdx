## How API Costs Work

Neosantara AI API usage is calculated based on **total tokens processed per request**, including both `input (your prompts)` and `output (AI responses)`. Each model has different pricing based on its capabilities and computational requirements.

### Cost Calculation Formula

- **Price = Tokens × Rp 0.15** (per token)
- **Price = (Tokens ÷ 1,000) × Rp 149.99** (per 1,000 tokens)

$$Price = \text{Tokens} \times \text{Rp } 0.15 \text{ (per token)}$$

$$Price = \left( \frac{\text{Tokens}}{1000} \right) \times \text{Rp } 149.99 \text{ (per 1,000 tokens)}$$

**Example:** For 100,000 tokens:
---
$$Price = 100,000 \times 0.15 = \text{Rp } 15,000$$
---
or
---
$$Price = \left( \frac{100,000}{1,000} \right) \times 149.99 = \text{Rp } 14,999$$

Both calculations yield approximately **Rp 15,000** (rounded for simplicity).

## Understanding Token Usage

### Basic Text Processing
Standard text requests (like [`chat completions`](/api-reference/chat)) consume tokens based on:
- **Input length:** Your prompts and conversation history
- **Output length:** The AI-generated response text

### Advanced Features
When using enhanced capabilities such as **function calling**, **web search**, or **vision**, token costs will be higher due to:
- Additional computational complexity
- Extra data processing requirements
- Enhanced model capabilities being utilized

The exact cost varies per request based on the specific operations performed by the model.

### Track Your Usage

For the most accurate tracking of your token consumption:

1. **API Response:** Check the `tokens_used` field using [`/auth/key`](/api-reference/authentication/check-api-key-status)
2. **Usage Dashboard:** Visit your [Usage Dashboard](https://app.neosantara.xyz/usage) to view:
