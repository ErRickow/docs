  </Step>
</Steps>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Understanding Caching" icon="database">
    **Cache Read:** When a model supports prompt caching, repeated input tokens are read from cache at a lower rate (typically 90% cheaper). If "N/A", the model doesn't support caching.
    
    **Cache Write:** The first time tokens are cached, they're billed at the standard input rate. Subsequent reads use the cheaper Cache Read rate.
    
    **Savings Example:** With Claude 4.5 Sonnet, cache reads cost $0.30/1M vs $3.00/1M for standard input—a 90% savings on repeated content!
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How Token Pricing Works" icon="calculator">
    Tokens are the basic units of text processing. Roughly:
    - **1 token ≈ 4 characters** in English
    - **1 token ≈ 2-3 characters** in Indonesian
    - **1M tokens ≈ 750,000 words** in English
    
    **Example Calculation:**
    - Model: `nusantara-base`
    - Input: 1,000 tokens (Rp 300 / 1M × 1,000 = **Rp 0.3**)
    - Output: 500 tokens (Rp 1,500 / 1M × 500 = **Rp 0.75**)
    - **Total: Rp 1.05** per request

### OCR (Optical Character Recognition)

Extract text from images at an affordable rate:

| Model | Price per Image |
| :--- | :--- |
| `deepseek-ocr` | **Rp 100** |

<Tip>
OCR pricing is per image, regardless of text length extracted. Process multiple pages efficiently!
</Tip>

---

### Tool Usage & Function Calling

<Info>
Tool usage costs are included in standard token pricing—no additional orchestration fees!
</Info>

When using function calling or tools:
- **Tool definitions** count as input tokens
- **Tool calls** count as output tokens
- **Tool results** count as input tokens

All billed at your selected model's standard rate.

**Example:** Using tools with `nusantara-base`:
- Tool definition: 200 tokens input = Rp 0.06
- Model's tool call: 50 tokens output = Rp 0.075
- Tool result: 150 tokens input = Rp 0.045
- **Total tool overhead: Rp 0.18**

## Throughput Tiers

<Card icon="gauge-high" title="Automatic Tier Upgrades" color="#3b82f6">
  Your tier automatically upgrades as your **cumulative lifetime deposits** increase. No manual action needed!
</Card>

### Rate Limits by Tier

| Tier | Min. Cumulative Deposit | RPM | ITPM | OTPM | Batch API |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Free** | Rp 0 | 3 | 5,000 | 2,000 | ❌ |
| **Basic** | **Rp 85,000** | 50 | 20,000 | 5,000 | ✅ |
| **Standard** | **Rp 670,000** | 1,000 | 100,000 | 25,000 | ✅ |
| **Pro** | **Rp 3,350,000** | 2,000 | 200,000 | 50,000 | ✅ |
| **Enterprise** | **Rp 6,700,000** | 4,000 | 500,000 | 125,000 | ✅ |

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What do RPM, ITPM, and OTPM mean?" icon="question">
    - **RPM (Requests Per Minute):** Maximum API requests you can make per minute
    - **ITPM (Input Tokens Per Minute):** Maximum input tokens processed per minute across all requests
    - **OTPM (Output Tokens Per Minute):** Maximum output tokens generated per minute across all requests
    
    All three limits apply simultaneously. Exceeding any limit will result in rate limit errors (429).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How tier upgrades work" icon="arrow-up">
    Tiers are based on your **total lifetime deposits**, not current balance:
    
    **Example:**
    1. You deposit Rp 100,000 → Unlock **Basic** tier
    2. You spend Rp 50,000 → Still **Basic** tier (deposit history counts)
    3. You deposit another Rp 600,000 → Unlock **Standard** tier
    
    Once unlocked, you **never lose** tier benefits, even if your balance decreases.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Need higher limits?" icon="rocket">
    For custom rate limits beyond Enterprise tier, [contact our sales team](https://neosantara.xyz/contact) to discuss:
    - Custom concurrent request limits
    - Dedicated infrastructure
    - Volume discounts
    - Priority support

## Cost Optimization Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Batch API for 50% Savings" icon="piggy-bank">
    For non-urgent tasks, always use the [Batch API](/api-reference/batches/overview) to cut costs in half. Perfect for:
    - Data labeling and classification
    - Bulk translations
    - Content generation pipelines
    - Embeddings for large datasets
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Choose the Right Model" icon="brain">
    Match model capability to task complexity:
    - **Simple tasks:** Use `llama-3.2-11b` (Rp 100/1M) or `nusantara-base` (Rp 300/1M)
    - **Medium tasks:** Use `gpt-oss-20b` (Rp 1,600/1M) or `gemma2-9b-it` (Rp 200/1M)
    - **Complex tasks:** Use `claude-sonnet-4.5` or specialized models only when needed
    
    **Savings:** Using a smaller model can reduce costs by 80-95%!
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Leverage Prompt Caching" icon="database">
    For models supporting caching (like Claude), structure prompts to reuse content:
    - Put static instructions/examples at the start
    - Cache reads cost 90% less than fresh inputs
    - Ideal for repeated queries with consistent context
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Optimize Token Usage" icon="scissors">
    - Set appropriate `max_tokens` limits
    - Use concise system prompts
    - Implement streaming to stop generation early if needed
    - Remove unnecessary whitespace and formatting
  </Accordion>
