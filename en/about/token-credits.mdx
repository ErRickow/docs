## Hybrid Billing System

Neosantara AI utilizes a flexible **Hybrid Billing System** designed to provide both predictability and scalability.

1.  **Subscription Quota (Included Tokens):** Every subscription plan (Free, Basic, etc.) comes with a monthly allowance of tokens. These are used first.
2.  **Pay-As-You-Go (Credit Balance):** Once your subscription quota is exhausted (or if you choose to switch), usage is billed directly from your **Credit Balance (IDR)**.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Using Your Quota
At the start of your billing cycle, you consume your **Monthly Token Quota**.
*   **Daily Limits:** Subscription plans enforce a *Daily Token Limit* to ensure fair usage distribution throughout the month. If you hit this daily limit, you must wait until the next day (00:00 UTC) or upgrade your plan.
*   **Monthly Reset:** Unused quota does not rollover; it resets on your billing date.

### 2. Switching to Pay-As-You-Go
When you deplete your **Monthly Quota**, the system automatically upgrades your account to **Pay-As-You-Go Mode**.
*   **Seamless Transition:** You will not experience downtime (unless your balance is empty).
*   **Bonus Balance:** We grant a one-time **Rp 10,000 bonus** to jumpstart your balance upon this transition.
*   **Unlimited Volume:** In Pay-As-You-Go mode, **Daily and Monthly volume limits are removed**. You are limited only by your available Credit Balance and technical throughput speeds (RPM/TPM).

## Subscription Plans (Quotas)

These plans determine your **Initial Quota** and your **Throughput Speed** (Tier).

| Plan | Daily Limit (Tokens) | Monthly Quota (Tokens) | Speed Tier |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Free** | 3,000 | 10,000 | Low |
| **Basic** | 10,000 | 66,667 | Medium |
| **Standard** | 40,000 | 400,000 | High |
| **Pro** | 100,000 | 1,000,000 | Ultra |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Custom | Custom |

<Note>
  **Important:** Once you switch to Pay-As-You-Go, the "Daily Limit" and "Monthly Quota" columns no longer apply. You gain **Unlimited Volume** capability.

### Cost Calculation Example

**Scenario:** You generate a blog post about Indonesian history using `nusantara-base`.
*   **Input:** 1,000 tokens (Prompt)
*   **Output:** 2,000 tokens (Article)

$$ Cost = (\frac{1,000}{1,000,000} \times 300) + (\frac{2,000}{1,000,000} \times 1,500) $$
$$ Cost = 0.3 + 3.0 = \text{Rp } 3.3 $$

**Total Cost:** Only **Rp 3.3** for the entire article.
