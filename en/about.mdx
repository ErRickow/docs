## Who are we?

**Neosantara AI (NAI) is independently developed and maintained by a dedicated individual** with a passion for making advanced AI technology accessible to developers and organizations. Our mission is to empower individuals and organizations with accurate, unbiased, and factual information through cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence technology.

## What is the Neosantara API?

Building AI applications that leverage real-time online information or advanced multimodal capabilities can be complex. Neosantara AI serves as a unified gateway platform that provides standardized API access to various state-of-the-art language models (LLMs) and multimodal AI models from multiple providers.

Instead of managing multiple API integrations, authentication systems, and billing platforms from different AI providers, Neosantara AI consolidates everything into a single, consistent API interface. This allows you to focus on building your core application while we handle the complexity of model integration, optimization, and reliability.

<Note>
   **Neosantara AI is an independent product and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or officially connected to these model providers**. We serve as an API gateway to help you interact with their technology through a unified interface.
