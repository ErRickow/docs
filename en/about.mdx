## How does the Neosantara AI API work??

The Neosantara AI API handles the complexities of interacting with various advanced AI models. Instead of managing multiple APIs from different providers, Neosantara AI acts as a single gateway. It takes care of all the overhead in selecting the best model, formatting requests, and optimizing responses, all within a single API call.

Neosantara AI can aggregate capabilities from various models to deliver the most relevant responses to your task, query, or goal. Additionally, Neosantara AI allows developers to add custom parameters such as context and limit response tokens to enable an optimal AI experience.

Neosantara AI can also help your AI agents make better decisions by providing structured information or summaries for cross-agent communication.

Here's a simplified diagram illustrating the core flow of the Neosantara AI API:
