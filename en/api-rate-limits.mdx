This page documents rate limits for Neosantara API endpoints. Limits vary by endpoint and service tier.

## Global & Per-Tier Limits

- Free / Starter: lower quotas, longer cooldowns
- Pro / Enterprise: higher quotas and burst capacity

## Per-Endpoint Limits (Examples)

- OpenAI Compatible: per-model, per-key quotas
- Anthropic Compatible: per-model quotas with tooling considerations
- Responses API: enhanced quotas with stateful context

## Backoff & Retry Guidance

- Use exponential backoff with jitter.
- Respect `Retry-After` headers when provided by the server.

## Monitoring & Observability

- Log request counts, latency, and error rates by endpoint.
- Instrument client-side metrics to maintain healthy quotas.
