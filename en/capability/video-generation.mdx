description: 'Generate high-quality videos from text prompts using GLM-4 Video.'
---

Neosantara AI provides a unified interface for video generation, powered by the **GLM-4 Video** model (CogVideoX). This capability allows you to create cinematic, high-resolution videos directly from text descriptions or by providing an image as a reference.

-----

### How to Use the API

Video generation is an asynchronous process. You first submit a job, and then poll for its status.

#### **1. Submit a Video Job**

Send a `POST` request to `/v1/videos`.

<CodeGroup>
```json cURL icon="terminal"
curl -X POST "https://api.neosantara.xyz/v1/videos" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <NAI_API_KEY>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "model": "cogvideox",
  "prompt": "A beautiful sunset over the Indonesian archipelago, cinematic lighting, 4k",
  "video_style": "cinematic"
}'
```
</CodeGroup>

**Parameters:**
- `model`: Required. Use `cogvideox` or `cogvideox-pro`.
- `prompt`: Required. A detailed description of the video you want to generate (max 2000 characters).
- `input_reference`: Optional. A URL to an image to use as a starting point (Image-to-Video).
- `video_style`: Optional. e.g., `cinematic`, `anime`, `realistic`.

#### **2. Check Job Status**

Use the `id` returned from the submission to check progress.

<CodeGroup>
```json cURL icon="terminal"
curl "https://api.neosantara.xyz/v1/videos/<JOB_ID>" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <NAI_API_KEY>"
```
</CodeGroup>

#### **3. Download Content**

Once the status is `completed`, retrieve the video file.

<CodeGroup>
```json cURL icon="terminal"
curl "https://api.neosantara.xyz/v1/videos/<JOB_ID>/content" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <NAI_API_KEY>"
```
</CodeGroup>

### Pricing & Quota

Video generation is a high-compute task and is billed per video generated.

| Model | Price (IDR) | Token Equivalent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **cogvideox** | Rp 15,000 | 7,500 Tokens |
| **cogvideox-pro** | Rp 25,000 | 12,500 Tokens |

<Note>
  If you are in **Pay-As-You-Go** mode, the cost will be deducted from your balance. For subscription users, it will count against your daily/monthly token quota using the token equivalent value.
</Note>

### Best Practices

*   **Be Descriptive**: Describe the subject, action, lighting, and camera movement.
*   **Resolution**: The model currently supports up to 1024x1024 or 720p output depending on the variant.
*   **Prompt Length**: Keep prompts under 2000 characters for optimal results.
