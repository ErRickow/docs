Embeddings are numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning. They convert human-readable text into high-dimensional vectors that machine learning models can understand and process. These vectors enable tasks such as semantic search, recommendation systems, clustering, and anomaly detection.

## How Embeddings Work

When you send text to the embeddings endpoint, the underlying AI model processes the text and outputs a list of floating-point numbers (a vector). Texts with similar meanings will have vectors that are numerically "closer" to each other in the high-dimensional space.

The NeosantaraAI API provides an `/v1/embeddings` endpoint to generate these vectors.

## Usage

To generate embeddings, send a POST request to the `/v1/embeddings` endpoint with your text input.

### Endpoint

`POST /v1/embeddings`

### Request Body

```json
{
  "input": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
  "model": "nusa-embedding-0001",
  "encoding_format": "float"
}
```

#### Parameters

* **`input`** (string or array of strings, **required**): The text(s) to embed. Can be a single string or an array of strings.
* **`model`** (string, optional, default: `"nusa-embedding-0001"`): The ID of the embedding model to use.
* **`encoding_format`** (string, optional, default: `"float"`): The format of the returned embeddings. Currently, `"float"` is the primary supported format.

### Supported Embedding Models

The NusantaraAI API supports various embedding models, often utilizing intelligent fallbacks to ensure reliability. Some of the available models include:

* **`nusa-embedding-0001`**: The primary embedding model, offering good performance for general-purpose embeddings.
* **`together-embed-v2-L`**: A large embedding model provided via Together AI, suitable for high-quality text embeddings.

### Example Response

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    {
      "object": "embedding",
      "embedding": [
        0.00539745,
        -0.007137805,
        0.02102179,
        -0.003181825,
        // ... (truncated for brevity)
        -0.010260487
      ],
      "index": 0
    }
  ],
  "model": "nusa-embedding-0001",
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 9,
    "total_tokens": 9
  },
  "_metadata": {
    "creator": "neosantara.xyz",
    "status": true,
    "tier": "Free"
    // ... (other metadata)
  }
}
```

## Python Example (with OpenAI SDK)

You can generate embeddings using the OpenAI Python SDK by configuring its `base_url` to point to the NusantaraAI API.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize the OpenAI client with your API key
# Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual NusantaraAI API Key
client = OpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://api.neosantara.xyz/v1"
)

def get_embeddings(texts: list[str], model: str = "nusa-embedding-0001"):
    """
    Generates embeddings for a list of texts using the NusantaraAI API.
    """
    print(f"Generating embeddings for model: {model}")

    try:
        response = client.embeddings.create(
            model=model,
            input=texts,
            encoding_format="float"
        )

        # The response.data contains a list of embedding objects
        # Each object has 'embedding' (the vector) and 'index'
        embeddings = [item.embedding for item in response.data]

        print(f"Generated {len(embeddings)} embeddings. Dimension: {len(embeddings[0]) if embeddings else 0}")
        print(f"Total tokens used: {response.usage.total_tokens}")

        return embeddings

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred during embedding generation: {e}")
        return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    example_texts = [
        "Artificial intelligence is transforming industries.",
        "Machine learning is a subset of AI.",
        "Deep learning enables neural networks."
    ]
    
    generated_vectors = get_embeddings(example_texts)

    if generated_vectors:
        print("\nFirst embedding vector (truncated):")
        print(generated_vectors[0][:10], "...") # Print first 10 elements
```
